# lab10 - Creating a web atlas

The goal of this lab is to have you create a basic web atlas. The distinction we are making here between a simple map and atlas refers to the fact that our web atlas will allow the user to toggle and reload different data layers. This lab will also introduce you to event handlers, which allow you to attach functionality to existing DOM elements and trigger specific changes on the webpage when the event occurs.

Refer to the previous lab for help with setting up your workspace.
